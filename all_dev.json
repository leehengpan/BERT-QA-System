When endothelial injury occurs , the endothelial cells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secrete von Willebrand factor which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after injury . Hemostasis has three major steps : 1 ) vasoconstriction , 2 ) temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug , and 3 ) blood coagulation , or formation of a fibrin clot . These processes seal the hole until tissues are repaired ."}, {"name": "Convention on the Rights of the Child", "id": "2911493370352980057", "questions": [{"input_text": "when was united nations convention on the rights of the child created"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "20 November 1989", "span_start": 116, "span_end": 132, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Convention on the Rights of the Child Parties to the convention Only signed , but not ratified Non-signatory Signed 20 November 1989 Location New York City Effective 2 September 1990 Condition 20 ratifications Signatories 140 Parties 196 ( all eligible states except the United States ) Depositary UN Secretary - General Languages Arabic , Chinese , English , French , Russian , Spanish UN Convention on the Rights of the Child at Wikisource"}, {"name": "Code talker", "id": "-1065148654910669702", "questions": [{"input_text": "who were the code talkers and what did they do"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was the transmission of secret tactical messages", "span_start": 365, "span_end": 482, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Code talkers are people in the 20th century who used obscure languages as a means of secret communication during wartime .

However , real eggs continue to be used in Eastern European tradition .

'' This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia , and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches , and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches .

Some members of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU , commonly referred to as suffragettes ) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women 's suffrage . In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal . However , the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges . The nickname of the Act came about because of a cat 's habit of playing with its prey ( a mouse ) before finishing it off ."}, {"name": "Lord Howe Island", "id": "7074317315274630741", "questions": [{"input_text": "when did lord howe island became a world heritage site"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "1982", "span_start": 1096, "span_end": 1100, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Lord Howe Island Satellite image of the island ; north is up .

The controlled synthesis of materials as thin films ( a process referred to as deposition ) is a fundamental step in many applications . A familiar example is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface . The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors , while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as sputtering . Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as magnetic recording media , electronic semiconductor devices , LEDs , optical coatings ( such as antireflective coatings ) , hard coatings on cutting tools , and for both energy generation ( e.g. thin - film solar cells ) and storage ( thin - film batteries ) . It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals , via thin - film drug delivery . A stack of thin films is called a multilayer ."}, {"name": "Colon Street", "id": "8324017764283655875", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is the oldest street in the philippines"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "Colon Street", "span_start": 0, "span_end": 12, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Colon Street is a historical street in downtown Cebu City that is often called the oldest and the shortest national road in the Philippines .

Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach , which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed . Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate , a base , to buffer the fluid , ensuring that it does not become too acidic . These cells also produce mucus , which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach . The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract ."}, {"name": "Stephen Curry", "id": "8968036245733884389", "questions": [{"input_text": "when did stephen curry won the mvp award"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "2015 , 2016", "span_start": 617, "span_end": 628, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Stephen Curry Curry in 2016 No. 30 -- Golden State Warriors Position Point guard League NBA ( 1988 - 03 - 14 ) March 14 , 1988 ( age 29 ) Akron , Ohio Nationality American Listed height 6 ft 3 in ( 1.91 m ) Listed weight 190 lb ( 86 kg ) Career information High school Charlotte Christian ( Charlotte , North Carolina ) College Davidson ( 2006 -- 2009 ) NBA draft 2009 / Round : 1 / Pick : 7th overall Selected by the Golden State Warriors Playing career 2009 -- present Career history 2009 -- present Golden State Warriors Career highlights and awards 2 \u00d7 NBA champion ( 2015 , 2017 ) 2 \u00d7 NBA Most Valuable Player ( 2015 , 2016 ) 5 \u00d7 NBA All - Star ( 2014 -- 2018 ) 2 \u00d7 All - NBA First Team ( 2015 , 2016 ) 2 \u00d7 All - NBA Second Team ( 2014 , 2017 ) NBA scoring champion ( 2016 ) NBA steals leader ( 2016 ) 50 -- 40 -- 90 club ( 2016 ) NBA Three - Point Contest champion ( 2015 ) NBA Sportsmanship Award ( 2011 ) NBA All - Rookie First Team ( 2010 ) AP Athlete of the Year ( 2015 ) Consensus first - team All - American ( 2009 ) Consensus second - team All - American ( 2008 ) NCAA Division I scoring leader ( 2009 ) 2 \u00d7 SoCon Player of the Year ( 2008 , 2009 ) Stats at NBA.com Stats at Basketball-Reference.com Medals ( hide ) Men 's basketball Representing United States FIBA World Cup 2010 Turkey National team 2014 Spain National team"}, {"name": "Tomato pur\u00e9e", "id": "-6731660837492850061", "questions": [{"input_text": "whats the difference between tomato paste and tomato puree"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "consistency", "span_start": 145, "span_end": 156, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Tomato pur\u00e9e is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes .

In ray diagrams ( such as the images on the right ) , real rays of light are always represented by full , solid lines ; perceived or extrapolated rays of light are represented by dashed lines . A real image occurs where rays converge , whereas a virtual image occurs where rays only appear to converge ."}, {"name": "Adidas Yeezy", "id": "-5548201381317088445", "questions": [{"input_text": "when did the first pair of yeezys come out"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "February 14 , 2015", "span_start": 189, "span_end": 207, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Adidas Yeezy Boost is the official collaboration sneaker by Kanye West and Adidas .

There are two forms of plasmodesmata : primary plasmodesmata , which are formed during cell division , and secondary plasmodesmata , which can form between mature cells ."}, {"name": "R/T", "id": "-3719623571078658627", "questions": [{"input_text": "what does rt mean on a dodge car"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "Road / Track", "span_start": 129, "span_end": 141, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "R / T is the performance marker used on Dodge automobiles since the 1960s ( much like Chevrolet Super Sport ) .

The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States .

The term was coined by Lederberg and Hays and shortly discovered by Tatum .

In nature , plasmids often carry genes that may benefit the survival of the organism , for example antibiotic resistance . While the chromosomes are big and contain all the essential genetic information for living under normal conditions , plasmids usually are very small and contain only additional genes that may be useful to the organism under certain situations or particular conditions . Artificial plasmids are widely used as vectors in molecular cloning , serving to drive the replication of recombinant DNA sequences within host organisms .", "questions": [{"input_text": "where is the dna found in a bacterial cell"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "no_answer"}]}, {"name": "Aniline", "id": "16962323076452787952", "has_correct_context": false, "contexts": "Aniline Names Preferred IUPAC name Aniline Systematic IUPAC name Benzenamine Other names Phenylamine Aminobenzene Benzamine Identifiers CAS Number 62 - 53 - 3 142 - 04 - 1 ( HCl ) 3D model ( JSmol ) Interactive image Interactive image ChEBI CHEBI : 17296 ChemSpider 5889 DrugBank DB06728 ECHA InfoCard 100.000. 491 KEGG C00292 PubChem CID 6115 8870 ( HCl ) UNII SIR7XX2F1K InChI ( show ) InChI = 1S / C6H7N / c7 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 5 - 6 / h1 - 5H , 7H2 Key : PAYRUJLWNCNPSJ - UHFFFAOYSA - N InChI = 1 / C6H7N / c7 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 5 - 6 / h1 - 5H , 7H2 Key : PAYRUJLWNCNPSJ - UHFFFAOYAP SMILES ( show ) Nc1ccccc1 c1ccc ( cc1 ) N Properties Chemical formula Molar mass 93.13 g mol Appearance Colorless to yellow liquid Density 1.0217 g / mL Melting point \u2212 6.3 \u00b0 C ( 20.7 \u00b0 F ; 266.8 K ) Boiling point 184.13 \u00b0 C ( 363.43 \u00b0 F ; 457.28 K ) Solubility in water 3.6 g / 100 mL at 20 \u00b0 C Vapor pressure 0.6 mmHg ( 20 \u00b0 C ) Acidity ( pK ) 4.6 ( for the conjugate acid ) Basicity ( pK ) 9.4 Magnetic susceptibility ( \u03c7 ) - 62.95 10 cm / mol Viscosity 3.71 cP ( 3.71 mPa s at 25 \u00b0 C ) Thermochemistry Std enthalpy of combustion ( \u0394 H ) - 3394 kJ / mol Hazards Main hazards potential occupational carcinogen Safety data sheet See : data page EU classification ( DSD ) ( outdated ) R - phrases ( outdated ) R23 / 24 / 25 R40 R41 R43 R48 / 23 / 24 / 25 R68 R50 S - phrases ( outdated ) ( S1 / 2 ) S26 S27 S36 / 37 / 39 S45 S46 S61 S63 NFPA 704 0 Flash point 70 \u00b0 C ( 158 \u00b0 F ; 343 K ) Autoignition temperature 770 \u00b0 C ( 1,420 \u00b0 F ; 1,040 K ) Explosive limits 1.3 % - 11 % Lethal dose or concentration ( LD , LC ) : LD ( lowest published ) 195 mg / kg ( dog , oral ) 250 mg / kg ( rat , oral ) 464 mg / kg ( mouse , oral ) 440 mg / kg ( rat , oral ) 400 mg / kg ( guinea pig , oral ) LC ( median concentration ) 175 ppm ( mouse , 7 hr ) LC ( lowest published ) 250 ppm ( rat , 4 hr ) 180 ppm ( cat , 8 hr ) US health exposure limits ( NIOSH ) : PEL ( Permissible ) TWA 5 ppm ( 19 mg / m ) ( skin ) REL ( Recommended ) Ca ( potential occupational carcinogen ) IDLH ( Immediate danger ) 100 ppm Related compounds Related aromatic amines 1 - Naphthylamine 2 - Naphthylamine Related compounds Phenylhydrazine Nitrosobenzene Nitrobenzene Supplementary data page Structure and properties Refractive index ( n ) , Dielectric constant ( \u03b5 ) , etc .

Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in ' court ballet ' , as it was royal money that dictated the ideas , literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time . The first formal ' court ballet ' ever recognized was staged in 1573 , ' Ballet des Polonais ' . In true form of royal entertainment , ' Ballet des Polonais ' was commissioned by Catherine de ' Medici to honor the Polish ambassadors who were visiting Paris upon the accession of Henry of Anjou to the throne of Poland . In 1581 , Catherine de ' Medici commissioned another court ballet , Ballet Comique de la Reine , however it was her compatriot , Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx , who organized the ballet . Catherine de ' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were responsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles of Baif 's Academie , by integrating poetry , dance , music and set design to convey a unified dramatic storyline .
